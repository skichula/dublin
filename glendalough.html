    <p>Glendalough is a beautiful monastic site that was founded by <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin in the 6th century. Its ruins are in a beautiful, green area with parks and picnic areas as well as being located next to two lakes. A great place to start your visit is the Visitor’s Center. </p>
    <h3>Visitor’s Center</h3>
    <p>Inside the visitor center you will find an indoor exhibit that you can walk through to learn about the history of the monastic city and <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin. Additionally, you can watch a short film inside which may be nice to include in your visit if the weather is not great; however, after exploring the exhibition you will want to get outside and see it all up close. The center is wheelchair accessible and has restrooms attached to the side of the building.</p>
    <h3>Monastic Site</h3>
    <p><span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin founded Glendalough and lived there as a hermit, dedicating his life to God. The ruins that you can explore include the iconic round tower that stands at about 30 meters high, still standing tall after over 1000 years. Other buildings to explore include the Cathedral, <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin’s Church, commonly known as <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin’s Kitchen.</p>

    <h3>Hiking & Nature</h3>
    <p>Due to the melting of an ancient glacier, the Glendalough Upper Lake was carved into a beautiful work of nature. Visitors can take a short paved hike to the lake which is surrounded by a park which is a great place to have a picnic or relax. On the way, you can stop and see the Lower Lake as well, which is a bit smaller and there is not as much space to sit and take it in. Further along the path, there are even some food trucks and picnic tables located off the path close to the lake, but I would reccommend packing a lunch and enjoying it right by the water.</p>
