    <h3>EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum</h3>
    <p>The EPIC Museum is a great exhibition to see and interact with the idea of Irish expanding far beyond the borders of Ireland. Through the stories of Irish emigrants including famous athletes, comedians, scientists, musicians, and political leaders, you can really get a sense of how such a small island can create a deep, vast culture worldwide. Through interactive touch screens, video, audio, and individuals’ stories, the experience is quite engaging. My favorite part was being able to stamp my EPIC passport as I traveled through each exhibit. To ensure you get the best deal, you can book tickets online through the <a href="https://epicchq.com/">EPIC Irish Emigration Museum website.</a></p>
    <p>I thought that this quote shown in the exhbit really encapsulates the history of Irish emigration and its impact on the world today:</p>
    <p>“After all, emigration is not just a chronicle of sorrow and regret. It is also a powerful story of contribution and adaptation. In fact, I have become more convinced each year that this great narrative of dispossession and belonging, which so often had its origins in sorrows and leave-taking, has become, with a certain amount of historic irony, one of the treasures of our society.” –Mary Robinson (February 2, 1995)</p>
