    <h3>Museums</h3>
    <h4>EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum</h4>
    <p>The EPIC Museum is a great exhibition to see and interact with the idea of Irish expanding far beyond the borders of Ireland. Through the stories of Irish emigrants including famous athletes, comedians, scientists, musicians, and political leaders, you can really get a sense of how such a small island can create a deep, vast culture worldwide. Through interactive touch screens, video, audio, and individuals’ stories, the experience is quite engaging. My favorite part was being able to stamp my EPIC passport as I traveled through each exhibit. To ensure you get the best deal, you can book tickets online through the <a href="https://epicchq.com/">EPIC Irish Emigration Museum website.</a></p>
    <p>I thought that this quote shown in the exhbit really encapsulates the history of Irish emigration and its impact on the world today:</p>
    <p class="quote">“After all, emigration is not just a chronicle of sorrow and regret. It is also a powerful story of contribution and adaptation. In fact, I have become more convinced each year that this great narrative of dispossession and belonging, which so often had its origins in sorrows and leave-taking, has become, with a certain amount of historic irony, one of the treasures of our society.” –Mary Robinson (February 2, 1995)</p>

    <h4>The Natural History Museum</h4>
    <h3>Restaurants</h3>
    <h4>Alma</h4>
    <p>A quaint restaurant tucked away in the Portobello area serving classic breakfast options with an Argentinian twist serves incredible brunch. There is limited seating, so if you want to make plans to go I would recommend <a href=https://www.alma.ie/book/">booking a table!</a> I would definitely recommend the Choripan Argento for a flavorful and satifying meal.</p>

    <h4>The Ramen Bar</h4>
    <p>Located on Williams Street, this ramen bar is nestled in a busy and happening area of downtown, yet the calm, relaxing atmosphere makes you feel tucked away from the chaos. While the mood lighting, comfortbale seating, and attentive service create a calming ambiance, the food is really the star of the show. There are plenty of authentic appextizers to try and share, but I ordered the house ramen dish and it was incredible. If you want to check out other options more in depth, look at their <a href=https://theramenbar.ie/uploads/source/RAMEN%20BAR_MENUS_ONLINE_AUG18%20-%20Dinner.pdf">online menu here!</a></p>
