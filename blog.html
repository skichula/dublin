        <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
        <p>Dublin has a rich history dating back to the vikings ifluence from Norway. Today, the city is vibrant and lively with great shopping, pubs, and historical sights to visit. A bus tour is a great way to see the city and learn about its rich history and culture. Here are a few fun facts from the bus tour I went on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dublin Castle does not look like your ordinary castle because it was blown to pieces as the gunpowder used to be stored next to the bakery.</li>
            <li>The spire, a 121 meter metal monument, was made for the turn of the millenium in 2003, but it is hated by locals for its odd, rather ugly appearance.</li>
        </ul>
