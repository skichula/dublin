            <p>Howth is a small fishing town about 18 kilometers (11 miles) outside of Dublin. The charming costal town is filled with cute gift shops, a market, various restaurants, and much more. The best views of the city and Dublin Day are from the summit, where you can hike out towards the lighthouse or choose from a few differnt trails that vary in length and difficulty. </p>

            <h3>Exploring Dublin: A Bus Tour</h3>
            <button class="accordion"><time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024 ~ Day 2</time></button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Dublin has a rich history dating back to the vikings influence from Norway. Today, the city is vibrant and lively with great shopping, pubs, and historical sights to visit. A bus tour is a great way to see the city and learn about its rich history and culture. Here are a few fun facts from the bus tour I went on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dublin Castle does not look like your ordinary castle because it was blown to pieces as the gunpowder used to be stored next to the bakery.</li>
                <li>The spire, a 121 meter metal monument, was made for the turn of the millenium in 2003, but it is hated by locals for its odd, rather ugly appearance.</li>
                <li>In the 19th century prior to the famine, Irish peasants were able to sustain themselves with a diet of only potatoes and buttermilk. The average man would eat about 14 pounds of potatoes every day!</li>
            </ul>

            <button class="accordion"><time datetime="2024-05-08">May 8, 2024 ~ Day 3</time></button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p> Grafton Street is one of the most famous locations in Dublin known for its great shopping and lively pubs, running from <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Stephen's Green in the south to College Green in the north. With plenty of options to choose from, there is something here for everyone. I’ve listed a few places I popped in, but you can find more information on the <a href ="https://www.graftonstreet.ie/">Grafton Street Website.</a>
            </p>
            <h4><span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Stephen's Green</h4>
            <p>As Ireland is known for its green, the city of Dublin also has wonderful parks and greenery right in the downtown area. If you are looking for a peaceful walking route, a pictureque lunch spot, or a people watching hub, <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Stephen's Green is an amazing park to check out. Located near Grafton Street and Trinity College, there is much to do nearby as well!</p>

            <h4>Ulysses Rare Books</h4>
            <p>Located just off Grafton Street, <a href="https://www.rarebooks.ie/">Ulysses Rare Books</a> is a gem that you don’t want to miss when strolling through town. Its quaint appearance creates a cozy atmosphere as you can browse from several famous authors and genres, with many first editions and signed copies available for purchase. Even if you are not a literary lover, you can find beauty in just looking at and holding these rare books in your hands.</p>

            <div class="panel">
            <p> After class, we were joined by Dr. David Williamas, the Academic Director for Computing at the Dublin School of Business, to learn about his research in gamification and machine learning.</p> 
            <p>Gamification refers to game design elements in non-game contexts including ideas of challenge, social, immersion, goal-oriented, feedback, progression, and playfulness.</p>
            <p>His wife, who works in web design and development for the Ireland Library System had great things to say about the challenges of starting with an inaccessible and unorganized site and where to begin in making it better. In fact, starting from scratch may be easier than modifying an extensive site from a rather chaotic start.</p>

            <h3>EPIC Museum & New York City-Dublin Portal</h3>
            <button class="accordion"><time datetime="2024-05-10">May 10, 2024 ~ Day 5</time></button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>Today we visited the EPIC museum on a self-guided tour which was a great way to learn more about how such a small country can have such a large international cultural impact. Able to go at my own pace allowed me to spend more time in some rooms when compared to others. I enjoyed learning about the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) and the sports of Gaelic football, hurling, camogie, and handball in the interactive exhibit. There is so much to learn especially related to Irish culture in the U.S. For instance, did you know that Rihanna had Irish roots or that there are about 1700 Irish pubs in the U.S. compared to only around 860 in Ireland?</p>
            <p>Afterwards, since we were on the North side of town, a few of us decided to check out the trending New York City-Dublin portal which connects the two cities with a live stream. The concept is quite cool, especially if you made plans to meet up with someone on the other side of the Atlantic, but unfortunately just a few days later it closed for inappropriate behavior. We will have to wait to see when it reopens, hopefully!</p>

            <div class="panel">
            <h4>Glendalough</h4>
            <p>Today, we woke up early and made our way to Glendalough and Kilkenny from Dublin via bus. About an hour and a half outside the city, Glendalough is a small monastic city located in a beautiful green area in between two lakes. It is a beautiful town and you can walk to take down the lake, but pack your lunch! I had possibly the worst burger and soft serve ice cream from the food trucks provided. There is plenty of picnic space right by the water to enjoy lunch while taking in the views. If you want to learn more about Glendalough and the history of the town, I wrote more about it on <a href="https://skichula.github.io/dublin/glendalough.html">my Glendalough page.</a></p>

            <h4>Kilkenny</h4>
            <p>Afterwards, we took a “scenic route” from Glendalough to Kilkenny, which actually just made us late for our guided tour of the Kilkenny castle! Fortunately, we were able to take a self-guided tour through the beautiful rooms and take in the intricate artwork and decorations. Since we were behind schedule, there was not much time to explore the rest of the quaint town, but I would love to come back and relax on the green across from the castle, visit the cathedrals in town, and do a bit more shopping. You can definitely spend an entire day or two here. If you want to learn more about Kilkenny and the castle, I wrote more about it on <a href="https://skichula.github.io/dublin/kilkenny.html">my Kilkenny page.</a></p>

            <h3>Day Trip to Northern Ireland</h3>
            <button class="accordion"><time datetime="2024-05-12">May 12, 2024 ~ Day 7</time></button>
            <div class="panel">
            <p>We woke up bright and early to make it to our tour bus to see Northern Ireland in the nick of time (the bus literally left right after we got on, 5 minutes early!). We booked a guided bus tour that took us from downtown Dublin to Belfast, Dunluce Castle, and Giant’s Causeway through <a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Dublin Titanic-Visitor-Experience-and-Giants-Causeway-Day-Trip-from-Dublin/d503-5300TITANIC">Wild Rover via Viator.</a> The total trip with all transportation and tours included was about 90 Euros. After crossing the border (really just a small sign), you can choose to either take a Black Taxi Cab Political Tour or visit the Titanic Museum. We chose the taxi tour, but the people on the bus split almost right down the middle, and I heard great things about both options.</p>
            <p>From our taxi tour, we didn’t see much more of Belfast since we were already headed further north towards Dunluce Castle and Giant’s Causeway. Both sites had amazing views and the bus ride as we got closer to the sites was also very picturesque. You definitely cannot miss these two sites. If you want to hear more about the tour, read about it on <a href="https://skichula.github.io/dublin/northern.html">my Northern Ireland page!</a></p>

            <p>It’s almost hard to believe that our first cold and rainy day was this far into the trip, but I’m not complaining. Therefore, we did not do much exploring downtown but we were still able to make a day out of it with brunch at Alma’s (if you want to learn more about the food, check out my Dublin page in the restaurant section), a trip to the National Disability Authority of Ireland, and trying what is to be said to be the best Guinness in all of Dublin at the Lord Edward (by one tour guide, so who knows?).</p>
            <p>The visit to the <a href="https://nda.ie/">National Disability Authority of Ireland (NDA)</a> was very interesting as we were able to compare web accessibility laws and guidelines between the United States and Ireland and the EU.</p>

            <div class="panel">
            <p>This day, we took the dart from Dublin at Pearse Station southbound to a charming coastal town nestled along the eastern shore of County Wicklow. As a nice getaway from the city, there were spectacular views of both the Irish Sea and mountainside. Even the train ride into and out of town provides wonderful views. We stopped for lunch at Martello’s before setting off on our hike. We did the Bray loop and it was incredible. It’s a rather easy to moderate hike, and the views are incredible on a clear day. We were able to see for miles all the way past Dublin. Additionally, there were some fun wildlife sightings including horses, cows, lots of birds, and even some slugs!</p>

            <p>After class, we took the Luas (tram) from downtown Dublin to Central Park to visit the Microsoft EMEA headquarters. We were able to tour the incredible office space that has way more than just desks. There is a yoga and meditation room, sleeping pods, entire gym and music room in the basement, plenty of cafes, and a gorgeous rooftop balcony that overlooks a horse track that hosts events once a week.</p>
            <p>After touring the office space, we were able to sit down and talk with a few employees who work as Swedish account executives about the move towards Artificial Intelligence, especially with Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI and their own co-pilot. It was fascinating to learn about how fast things change in comparison with other technological advances such as the cell phone and the Internet.</p>

            <p>Today we went on a walking tour of Dublin’s docklands and learned about the history of the neighborhood, changing from small cottages and a non-industrialized area to what it is today: a neighborhood with several finance and tech businesses located by the bay. Some of these businesses who recently settled in Dublin include Salesforce, Citi Bank, PwC, Indeed, and Google. As the industry grew so quickly, the housing in Dublin had to catch up. We were able to see the first apartment block which was not built until the late 90s; prior to that, there were only houses and flats available to live in.</p>

            <p>Today, we left Dublin bright and early to make our way to the other side of the island towards Galway! When we arrived, we dropped off our bags in the hostel we were staying in for the night and then did some initial exploring starting with the weekend markets! There, I got a classic Irish sausage and a green juice from two different sellers. We also walked around a few cute streets, hopping in and out of the touristy gift shops.

            <p>Next, we visited <a href="https://ccmireland.com/">the Computer and Communications Museum of Ireland</a> which housed a ton of old technological machines including old iMacs, telephones, radios, and gaming systems. The museum was very hands on and interactive as they had working models of a lot of what was on display. Some highlights include dialing on an old style, wind-up telephone, listening to music on a Sony walkman, and playing Fifa on an original Playstation!

            <p>Back in the city center, we went to <a href="https://quaysgalway.ie/">Quay’s pub</a> for a Guinness before having some fish and chips at McDonagh’s restaurant (not a fan favorite, unfortunately). After our meal, we took a long, leisurely walk towards the water at sunset, followed by some fun out and about on the West End. Overall, it was a jam packed day with lots of fun!

            <h3>Cliffs of Moher, Dunguaire Castle, & Obama Plaza
            </h3>

            <p>Leaving the city and heading to the countryside, we went on an amazing and picturesque drive towards the Cliffs of Moher. On the way, we stopped by the Dunguaire Castle, a small, stone castle built in 1520 resting on the shores of Galway bay. After a quick visit, we headed up the mountainside overlooking large green fields that stretched on forever and the Atlantic ocean. A few brave souls were even swimming in it!

            <p>It was a perfect day with clear skies, so the cliffs were breathtaking. If you would like to read more about the visit and see some pictures from the hike I took, check out <a href="https://skichula.github.io/dublin/cliffs.html">my Cliffs of Moher page!</a> On the way home, we stopped at Obama plaza which is exactly what you think it is: a Barack Obama themed gas station and service stop. They have a statue of Barack and Michelle Obama out front as well as some other U.S. president memorabilia inside. I have to say, the stop was quite fun.
