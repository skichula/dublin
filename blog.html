            <p>Howth is a small fishing town about 18 kilometers (11 miles) outside of Dublin. The charming costal town is filled with cute gift shops, a market, various restaurants, and much more. The best views of the city and Dublin Day are from the summit, where you can hike out towards the lighthouse or choose from a few differnt trails that vary in length and difficulty. </p>

            <h3>Exploring Dublin: A Bus Tour</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
            <p>Dublin has a rich history dating back to the vikings influence from Norway. Today, the city is vibrant and lively with great shopping, pubs, and historical sights to visit. A bus tour is a great way to see the city and learn about its rich history and culture. Here are a few fun facts from the bus tour I went on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dublin Castle does not look like your ordinary castle because it was blown to pieces as the gunpowder used to be stored next to the bakery.</li>
                <li>The spire, a 121 meter metal monument, was made for the turn of the millenium in 2003, but it is hated by locals for its odd, rather ugly appearance.</li>
                <li>In the 19th century prior to the famine, Irish peasants were able to sustain themselves with a diet of only potatoes and buttermilk. The average man would eat about 14 pounds of potatoes every day!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exploring Grafton Street Area</h3>
            <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 8, 2024</time>
            <p> Grafton Street is one of the most famous locations in Dublin known for its great shopping and lively pubs, running from St Stephen's Green in the south to College Green in the north. With plenty of options to choose from, there is something here for everyone. I’ve listed a few places I popped in, but you can find more information on the <a href ="https://www.graftonstreet.ie/">Grafton Street Website.</a>
            </p>
            <h4>St. Stephen's Green</h4>
            <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 8, 2024</time>
            <p>As Ireland is known for its green, the city of Dublin also has wonderful parks and greenery right in the downtown area. If you are looking for a peaceful walking route, a pictureque lunch spot, or a people watching hub, St. Stephen's Green is an amazing park to check out. Located near Grafton Street and Trinity College, there is much to do nearby as well!</p>

            <h4>Ulysses Rare Books</h4>
            <p>Located just off Grafton Street, <a href="https://www.rarebooks.ie/">Ulysses Rare Books</a> is a gem that you don’t want to miss when strolling through town. Its quaint appearance creates a cozy atmosphere as you can browse from several famous authors and genres, with many first editions and signed copies available for purchase. Even if you are not a literary lover, you can find beauty in just looking at and holding these rare books in your hands.</p>
