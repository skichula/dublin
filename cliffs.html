    <p>Glendalough is a beautiful monastic site that was founded by <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin in the 6th century. Its ruins are in a beautiful, green area with parks and picnic areas as well as being located next to two lakes. A great place to start your visit is the Visitor’s Center. </p>
    <h3>Visitor’s Center</h3>
    <p>Inside the visitor center you will find an indoor exhibit that you can walk through to learn about the history of the monastic city and <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin. Additionally, you can watch a short film inside which may be nice to include in your visit if the weather is not great; however, after exploring the exhibition you will want to get outside and see it all up close. The center is wheelchair accessible and has restrooms attached to the side of the building.</p>
    <h3>Monastic Site</h3>
    <p><span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin founded Glendalough and lived there as a hermit, dedicating his life to God.

Other buildings to explore include the Cathedral, <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin’s Church, commonly known as <span aria-label="Saint">St.</span> Kevin’s Kitchen.</p>
